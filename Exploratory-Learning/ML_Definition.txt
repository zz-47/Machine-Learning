Supervised Learning :  Uses Labeled data sets to train a model to predict the output of a given input.

 >> Regression : 

   > used to predict a value " for example a function y = f(x)  , were we give x and we want to know y (output)"
   > predictive values have infinite possible (y) outputs.
   > gives out a numeric value
   > we can use it for predicting house prices, stock prices, etc

 >> Classification :

   > Classification is a fundamental machine learning task with applications in binary, multiclass, multilabel, 
       and multioutput scenarios.
   > predicting small (finite) number of outputs.
   > the outputs are inform of classes/category (non numeric values)
   > can provide two or more outputs (for example, a binary classifier can output two classes: 0 and 1, 
       a multiclass classifier can output three classes: 0, 1, and 2, etc.)


UnSupervised Learning :  Uses unlabeled data sets to train a model to discover the underlying structure of the data.

 >> Clustering : 
    
    > the data comes with input x not the output y (indepent x is only depandency of output)
    > group similar data points together (clustering)
    > group data points into clusters based on their similarities
    > can be used for customer segmentation, image segmentation, etc.

 >> Anomaly detection : 
    
    > finding unsusual data points.
    > detect data points that are different from the rest of the data (anomalies)
    > detect data points that are unusual or different from the rest of the data
    > can be used for fraud detection, anomaly detection in medical data, etc.
  
 >> Dimensionality reduction : 
    
    > reduce the number of features in a dataset while retaining as much information as possible.
    > can be used for data visualization, feature selection, and data compression.
